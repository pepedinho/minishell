# This file contains the commands to be tested in minishell.
# Add one command per line.
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored. Empty lines will be ignored.

# The file is named test_commands.txt, the script checks for its name so do not rename it.
# Adding 'remove' as the last line will make the script remove it after it is done running. 
# Otherwise, the file will remain in the working directory and can be editted at will between runs.

# The script will NOT remove any files your minishell has created unless specified in the cleanup() function. By default, it will try to rm output1.txt up to output4.txt.

# The script does not handle commands that expect errors to be printed as error messages are typically custom.
# The script will run once you exit vim.

# Example commands:
echo "Hello, World!"
ls -l
pwd
cat Makefile | grep SRC | wc -l
